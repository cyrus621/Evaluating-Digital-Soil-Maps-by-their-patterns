# Abstract

Digital soil maps (DSM) of soil properties or classes are made at set grid resolutions, whereas soil patterns on the landscape have characteristic scales depending on the soil geomorphology. By segmenting a gridded map at various resolutions we attempt to identify soil patterns at various scales. The main aim is to evaluate DSM products in terms of how well they represent the soil landscape. The GeoPAT suite of programs can segment into (usually grouped) grid cells, minimum of 10x the original grid cell resolution of the source maps.

This script sets up the methods; separate scripts import the functions from here (exported with `purl`) and use them in case studies.

# Introduction

GeoPAT is an implementation of the concepts of Jasiewicz _et al._ (2018).

GeoPAT itself is described in Jasiewicz _et al._ (2015) and its full documentation is by Netzel _et al._ (2018).  Chapter 3 has basic workflows, Chapter 2 the detailed command descriptions.

@fig-workflow shows the segmentation workflow.

![Segmentation workflow (GeoPAT Manual)](./figs/GeoPAT_Fig3-13.png){#fig-workflow}

The segmentation can be followed by *regionalization*, i.e., grouping related patterns, in this case soil "combinations", into map units. Regionalization is by clustering segments output by `gpat_segment` into distinct pattern types.
Outputs of the `gpat_distmtx` module can be used as a distance matrix in a clustering program, of which there are many in R.

This document (so far) only produces and evaluates the segmentation.

# Setup

## Packages

The only non-base R packages are:

- `terra` to handle raster and vector structures

- `sf` "simple features" for some plots

- `ggplot` for GGPlot graphics

- `RColorBrewer` for palettes

- `aqp` for Shannon entropy

```{r}
#| label: packages
require(terra)
require(sf)
require(ggplot2)
require(RColorBrewer)
require(gstat) # variograms
require(aqp)   # entropy
```


## File paths

GeoPAT is a stand-alone program made of several modules, they must be called via R's `system` command. Source code is at https://github.com/Nowosad/geopat2. These commands must be compiled for each operating system, and the path will be different.

```{r}
# geopat_path <- "/Users/rossiter/dl/geoPAT_program/geopat2_MacOS"
geopat_path <- "/usr/local/bin"
gridhis_path <- file.path(geopat_path, "gpat_gridhis")
segment_path <- file.path(geopat_path, "gpat_segment")
segqual_path <- file.path(geopat_path, "gpat_segquality")
grid2txt_path <- file.path(geopat_path, "gpat_grid2txt")
distmtx_path <- file.path(geopat_path, "gpat_distmtx")
```

A base directory where we keep our GeoPAT input files (grids) and results (segmentation);
this path will be expanded for each case study.

```{r}
#| label: paths-1
base_path <- "/Users/rossiter/tmp/GeoPAT"
```

## Key parameters

Several choices influence the grid sizes that will be used to make segments. These should correspond to the map scale: soil associations, soil series, soil phases... related to the landscapes structure.

The defaults for grid creation in `geopat_gridhis` are

* `-z 150` *motifel size*, and 
* `-f 100` *shift*, both in input raster cell units.

A *motifel* ("motif element"?) is the elementary unit of analysis: a square block of pixels representing a local pattern. It is quantified by a histogram of features (e.g., co-occurrence, decomposition -- see below). Then distance between motifels is calculated as a distance between their histograms by various metrics, e.g., Jensen-Shannon Divergence). 

The *motifel size* defines the size of individual scene for which the histogram is calculated. 

The *shift* is the number of grid cells by which scenes shift along the grid in vertical and horizontal directions. The resolution of the output grid equals to the resolution of the input raster map multiplied by the shift.
For example shift is $100$ cells and the input raster has $25 \;\textrm{m}$ resolution, the output grid would have $25  \;\textrm{m} \times 100 = 2500 \;\textrm{m}$ resolution.

Thus the motifel size can be the shift size with some buffer; it could be the same, and it could even be smaller. If shift is set to the same value as motifel size, the input map will be simply divided into a grid of non-overlapping motifels. The idea of a larger motifel than size is to account for border effects.

A key part of the analysis is adjusting these until patterns emerge, at various scales.

## Helper functions

A function to compile Minimum Legible Area (in $\textrm{ha}$) from the scale. 
Input is the denominator of the scale ratio, e.g., for 1:50 000 it is 50 000.

```{r}
#| label: scale-to-mla
scale.to.mla <- function(scale.number) {
  return((((scale.number/1000)^2)/400))
}
```

The square root of this, when converted to $\textrm{m}^2$), is then the grid side in $\mathrm{m}$. Example:

```{r}
#| label: mla-to-scale
(mla <- scale.to.mla(50000))
sqrt(mla*(100^2))
```

So to correspond to a 1:50 000 scale map, we look for patterns in a `r sqrt(mla)` x `r sqrt(mla)` $\mathrm{m}^2$ grid cell, which corresponds to a MLA of `r mla` $\mathrm{m}^2$.

This function computes the shift, in map units, from the scale number. It is not used in the computation but can be called separately to figure out the desired shift.

The relative proportion of the motifel vs. shift can be adjusted elsewhere in the workflow.

Note that the segmentation combines the rectangular tiling into a "brick" topology, see GeoPAT manual Appendix A.
These cells are 2 x 2 of the square tiles. So to get the pattern at a given grid size, we need to specify the original grid size at 2x resolution.

```{r}
#| label: dimensions
grid.dimensions <- function(scale.number) {
  shift <- sqrt(scale.to.mla(scale.number)*(100^2))/2
  # /2 to account for aggregation in the segmentation phase
  return(shift)
}
```

Nominal scale from shift in meters:

```{r}
#| label: effective.scale
effective.scale <- function(shift.m) {
  return(shift.m*400)
}
```

The MLA used by the program will be 1/4 the size of the MLA for the given scale, this to allow the "brick" topology.

# Workflow

Here are functions for the workflow, adjustable with parameters.

The input map(s) must have been prepared as classified GeoTIFF.

## Grid signature

Build a pattern signature for maps using `gridhis`. A separate signature must be created for each layer, with that layer's statistics in the grid.

"This module extracts a grid-of-scenes (grid of pattern signatures, grid of motifels). The output is a grid of the same spatial extent as the input raster map, but with a different cell size. Each cell in a new grid has only one attribute - the signature of its pattern. Pattern is calculated over a window centered on the cell and having a user-defined size."

Arguments: 

0.`case_path`, where the files to process are found and results stored, as subdirectories `ds` and `results`

1. layer name of the property; file names are built from this
-- `source_TIFF` was the output of the data preparation for this layer
    It must be a classified raster
-- `input_GRID` will be the input to the segmentation

2. `shift.side` = shift size, in map units (e.g., meters)

3. `motifel.mult` = motifel size, as a proportion of shift.side, default $1.5$ -- this matches the ratio recommended in the manual (shift 100, motifel 150). From the manual: "Shift defines the resolution of the new grid. If window size is bigger than shift (recommended), motifels will overlap". So we set the default motifel to be 50% larger than the shift. It is the motifel that determines the size of the pattern.

4. `s` = signature type, default `cooc` "Spatial co-ocurrence of categories". See GeoPAT Manual Appendix B for options.

5. `n` = normalization type, default `pdf` (probability distribution function) which is recommended for `cooc`. See GeoPAT Manual Appendix C for options.


Outputs:

1. the signature grid as a GeoTIFF, input to the segmentation step

2. the signature grid as a text file (this is not yet used for more processing)

Returns:

1. vector with shift and motifel size, in grid units. This is used to keep outputs from different runs separate

The function computes the shift and motifel size from the resolution and a multiplier for the motifel side. But these can not be $< 10$ grid cells.

Some details on the methods:

From the `-l` option to `gpat_gridhis`:

List of signatures:

`prod`    Cartesian product of input category lists
`cooc`    Spatial coocurrence of categories
`fdec`    Full decomposition
`lind`    Landscape indices vector
`linds`   Selected landscape indices vector
`ent`     Shannon entropy


List of local normalization methods:

`01`      Normalize to the interval [0, 1]
`pdf`     Normalize to pdf (sum(hi) = 1)
`N01`     Normalize to N(0, 1) (hi=(hi-avg)/std)
`none`    Signature without any normalization

*Spatial co-ocurrence of categories*: `s = cooc` uses a color co-occurrence histogram, a variant of the Gray-Level Co- occurrence Matrix (GLCM) used to characterize texture in grayscale images. In GeoPAT, color is replaced by cell class and a single cell separation of one pixel is used to calculate a co-occurrence histogram. 

"The co-occurrence signature is designed to be effective in encapsulating spatial structures exhibiting high complexity patterns."

Alternatives are (1) to use a selected landscape index (FRAGSTATS-style); (2) a hierarchical decomposition.

*Probability Distribution Function* `n = pdf` normalization, i.e., fit the empirical distribution with the sample mean (to 0) and standard deviation (to 1), so all layers have the same weight.

Alternative is (1) stretch minimum and maximum to $[0 ... 1]$.

#  }
  return(c(f, z))
}
```


## Segmentation

The grids with signatures are inputs to the segmentation algorithm.

"This module segments a grid-of-scenes into regions of uniform patterns in the same fash- ion as traditional segmentation algorithms segment image (or other rasters) into segments of uniform color and texture. The difference is that `gpat_segment` segments a *grid-of-scenes* rather than an ordinary grid, and uses *scene signature as attribute* rather than color or image texture to decide how to delineate the segments."

See GeoPAT manual $\S2.2.2.3$ for details, and Appendix D for options. 

Accept the default "average" linkage, can specify "complete" linkage (`-c` argument).

Propose the default minimum distance thresholds to build areas from grids: `-lthreshold=0.1` (to control the sizes of segments) and `-uthreshold=0.3` (to prevent the growth of inhomogeneous segments). In multilayer segmentation "a motifel must meet the threshold conditions in all input layers to be joined to a segment. This is a rigorous solution and assure the full compatibility of all layers in the output segmentation."

These thresholds `{l,u}threshold` are the minimum and  maximum distance thresholds to build areas. To get larger segments, reduce the minimum and increase the maximum.

So this is quite strict: each layer's motifel in a grid cell must be similar enough to a neighbour's in order for them to merge. The `-uthreshold` can be relaxed for multi-layers, if the defaults give too fine a segmentation.

An alternative is to weight the layers (`-w=` argument, with a list of weights parallel to the list of layers).
"The weighted geometric mean of all layers in the motifel must be below the threshold to be joined to a segment. Weights allow to control the role of individual layers. Layer with a large weight value will have more impact on the resulting segmentation."

Another parameter is `-swap=0.001` by default. "There is a chance that some motifels located at segments’ boundaries show more affinity to motifels across the boundary than to motifels in its own segment. The swap parameter is used to alleviate this problem. It adjusts the boundaries between the segments." 

"For each border motifel its linkage to the parent segment, $D_\mathrm{par}$, as well as its linkage to the segment across the boundary, $D_\mathrm{neigh}$ is calculated. If the difference between $D_\mathrm{par}$ and $D_\mathrm{neigh}$ is positive (the linkage to the segment across the boundary is smaller than the linkage to parent segment) the motifel is marked for possible reassignment (resulting in an adjustment to the boundary). The boundary between segments is adjusted only when the swap value is larger than the difference between $D_\mathrm{par}$ and $D_\mathrm{neigh}$."

Function to do the segmentation, using GeoPAT command `gpat_segment`. 
Arguments:

0.`case_path`, where the files to process are found and results stored, in subdirectory `results`

1. Vector of layers (as names) to include in the segmentation calculation

2. `f.z` 2-element vector with shift and motifel, to label outputs

3. Similarity measure, default `jsd` (Jensen-Shannon Distance)

4, 5. Segmentation thresholds `{l,u}threshold`, defaults 0.1, 0.3

6. Vector of per-layer weights, default `NA`.

The segmentation output as grid and polygons are named by the layer list.

Input file is a GRID (signature); outputs are a raster TIFF with segments and a vector file GPKG also with segments.

The function returns the constructed names of the segments files.

```{r}
#| label: segment-it
# system(segment_path)
segment.it <- function(case_path, layers, f.z, 
                       m = "jsd", 
                       lthreshold = 0.1, uthreshold = 0.3, 
                       w = NA) {
 
  results_path <- file.path(case_path, "results")
  # 
  segmented.name <- paste(layers, collapse="-")
  if (nchar(segmented.name) > 64) segmented.name <- paste0("Layers", length(layers))
  segment_TIFF <- file.path(results_path, 
                            paste0(segmented.name, "_", f.z[1], "_", f.z[2], "_seg.tif")) # segmented grid
  segment_GPKG <- file.path(results_path, 
                            paste0(segmented.name, "_", f.z[1], "_", f.z[2], "_seg.gpkg")) # polygons
  input.names <- paste0(" -i ", file.path(results_path,
                                          paste0(layers, "_", f.z[1], "_", f.z[2], ".tif"))) #  input grid
  # make one (long) string of the inputs
  input.names <- paste(input.names, collapse = "  ")
  #
  system(paste0(segment_path, input.names,
                " -o ", segment_TIFF,
                " -v ", segment_GPKG,
                " -m ", m,
                if(!is.na(w[1])) { paste0(" -w=",w) },
#                " -c",          # complete linkage
               paste0(" --lthreshold=", lthreshold),
               paste0(" --uthreshold=", uthreshold),
               " --swap=0.001") # low value to encourage swapping
#                " --maxhist=0"  # turn off leveraging, increased computation
  )
  # report the number of segments
  # tmp <- vect(segment_GPKG)
  # print(paste("Number of segments:", nrow(tmp)))
  return(c(segment_TIFF, segment_GPKG))
}
```


## Evaluation

The quality of the segmentation can be computed for each input layer, i.e., how well was that layer segmented, whether it was segmented as one layer or as part of a multi-layer segmentation.

Arguments:

0. `case_path`, where the files to evaluate are found, in subdirectory `results`

1. layers for which to evaluate the segmentation

2. `segment_m_TIFF` The segmentation results  `.tif` from the previous step

3. `f.z` 2-element vector with shift and motifel, to label outputs

4. Similarity measure, default `jsd` (Jensen-Shannon Divergence)

It produces two output maps, one for the internal inhomogeneity of a grid, and one for its isolation from its neighbours. Their names are returned

```{r qual.m}
#| label: evaluate-it
# system(segqual_path)
evaluate.it <- function(case_path, layers, segment_m_TIFF, f.z, m = "jsd") {

  results_path <- file.path(case_path, "results")
  #
  segmented.name <- paste(paste0(layers, "_", f.z[1], "_", f.z[2]), collapse="-")
  if (nchar(segmented.name) > 64) segmented.name <- paste0("Layers", length(layers), "_", f.z[1], "_", f.z[2])
  inhomogeneity_m_TIFF <- file.path(results_path, paste0(segmented.name,  "_inhomo.tif")) 
  isolation_m_TIFF <- file.path(results_path, paste0(segmented.name, "_iso.tif")) 
  input.names <- paste0(" -i ", file.path(results_path, paste0(layers, "_", f.z[1], "_", f.z[2] , ".tif")))
  #
  system(paste0(segqual_path, input.names,
                " -s ", segment_m_TIFF,
                " -g ", inhomogeneity_m_TIFF,
                " -o ", isolation_m_TIFF,
                " -m", m))
  #
  return(c(inhomogeneity_m_TIFF, isolation_m_TIFF))
}
```

## Computation

A function to compute and display all the steps.

Arguments:

1. `shift.side` number of cells on a side of the grid

2. `case_path` base directory where the source DSM raster layers are stored in
    subdirectory `ds` and where the results will be stored in subdirectory `results`.

3. `layers` list of layers in that directory

4. `motifel.mult` size of motifel grid side, as a proportion of the shift size; default $1.5$

5. `s` signature type, default `cooc`, see `make.signature()`

6. `n` normalization type, default `pdf`, see `make.signature()`

7. `m` similarity metric, default `jsd` = Jensen-Shannon distane

8. `thresholds` two-element vector with the lower and upper segmentation thresholds, default `c(0.1, 0.3)`

9. Per-layer weights, default `NA`.

10. `plot.seg.numbers` whether or not to plot segment #s on maps, default `FALSE`; this can be useful for understanding why segments are built as they are.

11. `palette` to use when plotting maps with segment boundaries overlaid. Default `""` will give the terra default terra::map.pal("viridis")

12. `variogram.analysis` to compute fitted variogram parameters for each segment, summarize them, and plot. Default `FALSE` because this is *very* time-consuming. Probably should only be turned on when there are 50 or fewer segments.

Returns:

1. Number of segments

Side effects: summarizes and maps evaluation statistics
