  abstract = {We performed a systematic mapping of validation methods used in digital soil mapping (DSM), in order to gain an overview of current practices and make recommendations for future publications on DSM studies. A systematic search and screening procedure, largely following the RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) protocol, was carried out. It yielded a database of 188 peer-reviewed DSM studies from the past two decades, all written in English and all presenting a raster map of a continuous soil property. Review of the full texts showed that most publications (97\%) included some type of map validation, while just over one-third (35\%) estimated map uncertainty. Most commonly, a combination of multiple (existing) soil sampling data was used and the resulting maps were validated by single data-splitting or cross-validation. It was also common for essential information to be lacking in method descriptions. This is unfortunate, as lack of information on sampling design (missing in 25\% of 188 studies) and sample support (missing in 45\% of 188 studies) makes it difficult to interpret what derived validation metrics represent, compromising their usefulness. Therefore, we present a list of method details that should be provided in DSM studies. We also provide a detailed summary of the 28 validation metrics used in published DSM studies, how to interpret the values obtained, and whether the metrics can be compared between datasets or soil attributes.},

  abstract = {The increase in digital soil mapping around the world means that appropriate and efficient sampling strategies are needed for validation. Data used for calibrating a digital soil mapping model typically are non-random samples. In such a case we recommend collection of additional independent data and validation of the soil map by a design-based sampling strategy involving probability sampling and design-based estimation of quality measures. An important advantage over validation by data-splitting or cross-validation is that model-free estimates of the quality measures and their standard errors can be obtained, and thus no assumptions on the spatial auto-correlation of prediction errors need to be made. The quality of quantitative soil maps can be quantified by the spatial cumulative distribution function (SCDF) of the prediction errors, whereas for categorical soil maps the overall purity and the map unit purities (user's accuracies) and soil class representation (producer's accuracies) are suitable quality measures. The suitability of five basic types of random sampling design for soil map validation was evaluated: simple, stratified simple, systematic, cluster and two-stage random sampling. Stratified simple random sampling is generally a good choice: it is simple to implement, estimation of the quality measures and their precision is straightforward, it gives relatively precise estimates, and no assumptions are needed in quantifying the standard error of the estimated quality measures. Validation by probability sampling is illustrated with two case studies. A categorical soil map on point support depicting soil classes in the province of Drenthe of the Netherlands (268 000 ha) was validated by stratified simple random sampling. Sub-areas with different expected purities were used as strata. The estimated overall purity was 58\% with a standard error of 4\%. This was 9\% smaller than the theoretical purity computed with the model. Map unit purities and class representations were estimated by the ratio estimator. A quantitative soil map, depicting the average soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of pixels in an area of 81 600 ha in Senegal, was validated by random transect sampling. SOC predictions were seriously biased, and the random error was considerable. Both case studies underpin the importance of independent validation of soil maps by probability sampling, to avoid unfounded trust in visually attractive maps produced by advanced pedometric techniques.}

  abstract = {Initial units of the soil mantle are elementary soil areals which break up into three groups: homogeneous, sporadically spotted, and regular cyclic. Soil combinations consist of elementary soil areals which are genetically linked to various degrees and which produce a definite pattern in the soil mantle. These combinations are the smallest integral sectors of the structure of the mantle. Multiple spatial repetition of a certain soil combination or several soil combinations alternating in a definite order creates various forms of structures of the soil mantle. At the same time, soil combinations can be regarded as models of structures of the soil mantle. According to the character of genetic links between the components and the degree of contrast, the following six classes of soil combinations are singled out: complexes, spottinesses, catenas, variations, mosaics and tachets. Soil combinations are characterized by their composition, genetic and geometric forms, differentiation factors, history of development, degrees of stability, complexity and contrast. A classification of genetic and geometric forms of soil combinations is suggested which reflects the history of the soil mantle development and factors of its differentiation. The structure of the soil mantle is usually a multi-stage one, i.e., the simpler combinations constitute more complex ones. The study of the soil mantle structure provides the grounds for the elaboration of a system of cartographic units to show more completely and accurately the soil mantle on maps of different scales and purposes. The data on the structure of the soil mantle make it possible to effect more accurately all kinds of soil regionalization and predictions of the evolution of the soil mantle under natural conditions and under the influence of man.}

  abstract = {One of the great difficulties in soil classification is that soils rarely exist as discrete individuals with clear boun- daries. Instead, they grade to other soils across broad transition belts and their boundaries are determined by definition. Two new concepts, the pedon and the soil individual, have been proposed to help clarify relations between the soil continuum and soil taxonomic classes. Pedons are real, natural soil volumes just large enough to show all the soil horizons present and their relation- ships. Boundaries of pedons do not depend on reference to any taxonomic scheme. A soil individual (polypedon) is also a real soil body; it is a parcel of contiguous pedons all of which have characteristics lying within the defined limits of a single soil series. Pedons may be considered as building blocks that make up both soil taxonomic classes and soil mapping units. Most pedons are too small to exhibit all the characteristics of a soil individual; for example, usually they do not show shape of the soil nor nature of its boundaries with other soils. Soil individuals (polypedons) are the subject of soil taxonomy; they are the real objects that are classified. They are comparable to individual pine trees, individual fish, and individual men.},

  abstract = {We present and evaluate a quantitative method for delineation of ecophysiographic regions throughout the entire terrestrial landmass. The method uses the new pattern-based segmentation technique which attempts to emulate the qualitative, weight-of-evidence approach to a delineation of ecoregions in a computer code. An ecophysiographic region is characterized by homogeneous physiography defined by the cohesiveness of patterns of four variables: land cover, soils, landforms, and climatic patterns. Homogeneous physiography is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a region to be an ecoregion, thus machine delineation of ecophysiographic regions is the first, important step toward global ecoregionalization. In this paper, we focus on the first-order approximation of the proposed method \textendash{} delineation on the basis of the patterns of the land cover alone. We justify this approximation by the existence of significant spatial associations between various physiographic variables. Resulting ecophysiographic regionalization (ECOR) is shown to be more physiographically homogeneous than existing global ecoregionalizations (Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEW) and Bailey's Ecoregions of the Continents (BEC)). The presented quantitative method has an advantage of being transparent and objective. It can be verified, easily updated, modified and customized for specific applications. Each region in ECOR contains detailed, SQL-searchable information about physiographic patterns within it. It also has a computer-generated label. To give a sense of how ECOR compares to TEW and, in the U.S., to EPA Level III ecoregions, we contrast these different delineations using two specific sites as examples. We conclude that ECOR yields regionalization somewhat similar to EPA level III ecoregions, but for the entire world, and by automatic means.},

Many methods for calculating such associations have been proposed, but the case when both variables are categorical is underdeveloped despite the fact that many datasets of interest are in the form of either regionalizations or thematic maps. In this paper, we advance this case by adapting the so-called -measure method from its original information-theoretical formulation to the analysis of variance formulation which provides more insight for spatial analysis. We present a step-by-step derivation of the -measure from the perspective of the analysis of variance. The method produces three indices of global association and two sets of local association indicators which could be mapped to indicate spatial distribution of association strength. The open-source software for calculating all indices from vector datasets accompanies the paper. To showcase the utility of the -measure, we identified three different application contexts: comparative, associative, and derivative, and present an example of each of them. The -measure method has several advantages over the widely used Mapcurves method, it has clear interpretations in terms of mutual information as well as in terms of analysis of variance, it provides more precise assessment of association, it is ready-to-use through the accompanying software, and the examples given in the paper serves as a guide to the gamut of its possible applications. Two specific contributions stemming from our re-analysis of the -measure are the finding of the conceptual flaw in the Geographical Detector\textemdash a method to quantify associations between numerical and categorical spatial variables, and a proposal for the new, cartographically based algorithm for finding an optimal number of regions in clustering-derived regionalizations.},

  abstract = {Analyzing large Earth Observation (EO) data on the broad spatial scales frequently involves regionalization of patterns. To automate this process we present a segmentation algorithm designed specifically to delineate segments containing quasi-stationary patterns. The algorithm is designed to work with patterns of a categorical variable. This makes it possible to analyze very large spatial datasets (for example, a global land cover) in their entirety. An input categorical raster is first tessellated into small square tiles to form a new, coarser, grid of tiles. A mosaic of categories within each tile forms a local pattern, and the segmentation algorithm partitions the grid of tiles while maintaining the cohesion of pattern in each segment. The algorithm is based on the principle of seeded region growing (SRG) but it also includes segment merging and other enhancements to segmentation quality. Our key contribution is an extension of the concept of segmentation to grids in which each cell has a non-negligible size and contains a complex data structure (histograms of pattern features). Specific modification of a standard SRG algorithm include: working in a distance space with complex data objects, introducing six-connected "brick wall" topology of the grid to decrease artifacts associated with tessellation of geographical space, constructing the SRG priority queue of seeds on the basis of local homogeneity of patterns, and using a content-dependent value of segment-growing threshold. The detailed description of the algorithm is given followed by an assessment of its performance on test datasets representing three pertinent themes of land cover, topography, and a high-resolution image. Pattern-based segmentation algorithm will find application in ecology, forestry, geomorphology, land management, and agriculture. The algorithm is implemented as a module of GeoPAT - an already existing, open source toolbox for performing pattern-based analysis of categorical rasters.},

Landscape metrics are a widely used tool for the analysis of patch-based, discrete land-cover classes. Existing software to calculate landscape metrics has several constraints, such as being limited to a single platform, not being open-source or involving a complicated integration into large workflows. We present landscapemetrics, an open-source R package that overcomes many constraints of existing landscape metric software. The package includes an extensive collection of commonly used landscape metrics in a tidy workflow. To facilitate the integration into large workflows, landscapemetrics is based on a well-established spatial framework in R. This allows pre-processing of land-cover maps or further statistical analysis without importing and exporting the data from and to different software environments. Additionally, the package provides many utility functions to visualize, extract, and sample landscape metrics. Lastly, we provide building-blocks to motivate the development and integration of new metrics in the future. We demonstrate the usage and advantages of landscapemetrics by analysing the influence of different sampling schemes on the estimation of landscape metrics. In so doing, we demonstrate the many advantages of the package, especially its easy integration into large workflows. These new developments should help with the integration of landscape analysis in ecological research, given that ecologists are increasingly using R for the statistical analysis, modelling and visualization of spatial data.}

However, to date there exists little guidance on which methods yield the most accurate estimates of model performance. We conducted simulations to compare model performance estimates produced by five common CV methods fit to spatially structured data. We found spatial CV approaches generally improved upon resubstitution and V-fold CV estimates, particularly when approaches which combined assessment sets of spatially conjunct observations with spatial exclusion buffers. To facilitate use of these techniques, we introduce the `spatialsample` package which provides tooling for performing spatial CV as part of the broader tidymodels modeling framework.},

Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods.

  abstract = {A common task is to measure the difference between two maps that show the same spatial extent for the same categorical variable, such as land-cover type. One popular technique is to express the overall difference as the sum of two components called quantity and allocation. This article shows how to take an additional step to express allocation difference as the sum of two components called exchange and shift. Exchange exists for a pair of pixels when one pixel is classified as category A in the first map and as category B in the second map, while simultaneously the paired pixel is classified as category B in the first map and as category A in the second map. If there are more than two categories, then it is possible to have a component called shift, which is allocation difference that is not exchange. Our article shows how to compute all three components of overall difference: quantity, exchange, and shift. We show also how to compute the three components for each category and to reveal the category pairs that account for the largest exchanges. Our article applies the principles to characterize both temporal changes and classification errors using land-cover maps from suburban Massachusetts, USA.},

  abstract = {The family of Kappa indices of agreement claim to compare a map's observed classification accuracy relative to the expected accuracy of baseline maps that can have two types of randomness: (1) random distribution of the quantity of each category and (2) random spatial allocation of the categories. Use of the Kappa indices has become part of the culture in remote sensing and other fields. This article exam- ines five different Kappa indices, some of which were derived by the first author in 2000. We expose the indices' properties mathematically and illustrate their limitations graphically, with emphasis on Kappa's use of randomness as a baseline, and the often-ignored conversion from an observed sample matrix to the estimated population matrix. This article concludes that these Kappa indices are useless, mis-leading and/or flawed for the practical applications in remote sensing that we have seen. After more than a decade of working with these indices, we recommend that the profession abandon the use of Kappa indices for purposes of accuracy assessment and map comparison, and instead summarize the cross-tabulation matrix with two much simpler summary parameters: quantity disagreement and alloca- tion disagreement. This article shows how to compute these two parameters using examples taken from peer-reviewed literature}
