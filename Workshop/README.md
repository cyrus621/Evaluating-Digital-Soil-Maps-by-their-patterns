# Tutorial: Evaluating Digital Soil Maps by their patterns

This *tutorial*, written as a Quarto document, presents methods to evaluate the spatial patterns of the spatial distribution of soil properties and map units as shown in gridded maps produced by digital soil mapping (DSM). It compares patterns from different DSM products to each other, and to spatial patterns known from detailed field surveys or known to local experts but not represented (yet) on maps. Methods include whole-map statistics, visually identifiable landscape features, level of detail, range and strength of spatial autocorrelation, landscape metrics (Shannon diversity and evenness, shape, aggregation, mean fractal dimension, and co-occurrence vectors), and spatial patterns of property maps classified by histogram equalization or user-defined cutpoints. The tutorial also shows how to use patterns within a window to partition a soil landscape into zones with similar patterns. This workshop uses examples from the USA, but the methods are applicable to any gridded DSM product or polygon map of soil classes.
